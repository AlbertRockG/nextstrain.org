    # is being run by folks in Seattle. When it is being run by folks
    # in Switzerland, ncov build data is usually published by 16:00 UTC,
    # so this update will lag behind that by ~9 hours. It can also be
    # triggered from the command line at any time with a respository_dispatch (below)."
