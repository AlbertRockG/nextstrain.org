# This file contains a list of known community datasets & narratives.
# For more information on community datasets please see
# https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/guides/share/community-builds.html
# 
# Please add your dataset / narrative to this list via a PR
#
# Note that this YAML file is the first version in our long-term plans
# to allow display / search of known (shared) datasets & narratives.
# We plan to improve functionality here in at least 2 ways:
# 1. Extract metadata from the underlying dataset/narrative file for richer
#    display and search functionality.
# 2. Ability to add a single repository here and we'll automatically
#    list all datasets & narratives there.
